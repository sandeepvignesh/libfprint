    After lot 713, Microsoft fingerprint readers changed. The new version
    comes with a new USB product ID and a challenge-response authentication
    scheme where the device challenges the authenticity of the driver.
    
    An independent third party produced documentation on the computations
    needed to convert a challenge into the correct response, and I then used
    this documentation to produce a clean-room reimplementation of the
    authentication scheme.

    aes1610: imaging improvements
    
    bz threshold is now 10 (instead of 15). I think it is ok for the moment.
    If we manage to get higher image quality in the future, we'll change that.
    
    max_frame is set to 350. 150 was too low => incomplete fingerprints
    
    the driver was designed to stop the acquisition as soon as it gets a blank
    frame (=> incomplete fingerprints). Now it waits to have at least 50 blank
    frames before stopping.

    This is an active capacitance swipe-type device similar to but smaller
    than the AES2501.
    
    Image processing performance is good but matching performance is not so
    good. The bozorth3 matcher needs tweaking in order to better cope with
    small sets of minutiae.
    
    With a lowered threshold, matching performance is good enough for now.

    Rework some image handling; add public binarization API
    
    I want to offer the ability for an application to view a binarized
    version of a scanned print. This lead onto a few changes:
    
     1. Store minutiae and binarized data inside fp_img
     2. Move resize code to the capture path, it previously happened much
        later.
     3. Add fp_img_binarize() to return a new image in binarized form.
     4. Add a BINARIZED_FORM flag to prevent an image being binarized again.
    
    In future, it would be nice to be able to binarize without detecting
    minutiae, but this involves some work on the NBIS interaction.

    possible with a little effort. Remove the lowered match threshold.

    aes2501: write multiple registers simultaneously
    
    Instead of writing each register in a separate USB transaction, we now
    write up to 16 at once.
    
    This drastically improves scan image quality due to reducing the amount of
    time needed per iteration of the sampling loop (sending 1 USB transaction
    per iteration instead of 7).

    Add AES2501 driver
    
    This driver works quite nicely. Seems a little too sensitive though (too
    much black in the standardized image, not enough ridge gap definition).
    
    Processing results are quite good, but you need a good enrollment image
    (i.e. long!). It's best to get such images by pressing harder than you
    might think necessary and swiping slowly.

    Custom image resizing
    
    mindtct appears to completely ignore the pixels-per-mm input parameter
    (ippmm). When processing AES4000 images, the binarized image is
    completely mangled and a lot of ridge information is lost.
    
    Resizing the AES4000's small images results in a huge imaging performance
    gain.
    
    We use imagemagick for the resizing, as it's resizing code resamples the
    image too (smoothing it out), which further improves performance.

    aes4000: image quality improvements
    
    The windows driver takes one sample at the previous register settings
    and then changes some registers before resamping (and getting much better
    images). The exact changes that it makes seem to vary, perhaps based on
    the histogram.
    
    Anyway, this is an approximation of the settings used for the 2nd sample
    which should help matching results.

    uru4000: retry scanner powerup 3 times
    
    When we include the await_finger_off procedure (i.e. set mode 12), the
    current power-up code is unreliable - no 56aa interrupt arrives sometimes.
    Comparing the F0 data and hwstat at this point between a working and a
    non-working run yields no differences.
    
    Work around this issue by retrying power-on 3 times.

    uru4000: interrupt handling fixes
    
    This should improve driver stability somewhat. Powerup problems seem to
    happen when we receive 3 unrelated interrupts while waiting for the
    power-on interrupt, so let's assume that the device can only buffer 3
    interrupts, and when the buffer is full, it discards new ones.
    
    When we detect a possible buffer overflow, ask the caller to retry the
    operation.
    
    Also, saw the interrupt of death a few times, so add in a warning when
    this happens. Haven't seen it since handling interrupt overflows though.

    Print discovery
    
    Add concept of "discovered prints" and flesh out the API. A discovered print
    was found based on file name but has not been checked for file integrity,
    and of course there is no guarantee that it is usable when you try to
    use it later (might have been deleted, etc).
    
    The .fprint directory structure was changed - instead of using mnemonics
    like "rind" we use their numeric value in the fp_finger enum as the filename.

    Improve print_data structure and on-disk format
    
    Drivers now have an ID number. These will be assigned by me and documented
    on the wiki. 0 cannot be used.
    
    Drivers now define a devtype for each device they initialise. This is to
    cope with the situation where a driver can support varying devices where
    their print data is incompatible (i.e. image scaling is totally changed).
    This doesn't apply to any existing supported devices.
    
    Print data no longer includes driver name, and includes driver ID instead.
    
    Paths to saved print data now include driver ID and devtype, and no longer
    include driver name.
    
    APIs exposed for converting a print_data into a blob which can then
    be loaded back again later. Useful for systems who don't want to use
    my simple storage system (which is only aimed at a single user).
    
    File format is now defined and will be documented on the wiki. The header
    is larger as we can no longer rely on directory paths in all scenarios.
    
    Print data compat check now checks devtype and driver ID.

    Improved image dimension handling
    
    Drivers now specify the size of the image they provide, and theres an API
    so that you can get the size of an image before you capture it.

    Pass driver_data from ID table to driver init function

commit 2709c6dc8c2429c3202b88b709593376d69392e5
Author: Daniel Drake <dsd@cs.manchester.ac.uk>
Date:   Tue Oct 23 23:24:21 2007 +0100

    Basic image driver foundations
    
    The basic model is that image drivers declare a fp_img_driver structure
    rather than a fp_driver struct. fp_img_driver will contain primitive imaging
    operations such as 'scan finger and return image'. The imgdev layer will
    generically implement the primitive fp_driver operations, and the imgdev
    layer will fix up the enroll/verify/etc pointers at driver registration
    time.
    
    Removed const from all fp_driver declarations, as these are now modified
    dynamically in the case of imaging drivers.

    storage: add save/load functionality
    
    Prints can now be saved to disk (but you currently must classify which
    finger they are) and you can load them later.
    
    Added 2 simple example programs to demonstrate this.

    Enrollment: improved error reporting
    
    Convert enrollment function to return a signed integer, which is negative
    on error or corresponds into fp_enroll_result otherwise.
    Now we can treat a 'FAIL' condition differently from an actual error: fail
    means that enrollment didn't complete because the data was nonsense or
    whatever (e.g. scanned a different finger for each stage?).
    
    Updated upekts accordingly.

    upekts: communication handling and enrollment implementation
    
    This completes an enrollment implementation for the upekts driver.
    It's based on code from libthinkfinger, but as there seemed to be many
    unknown details there, I spent some time analysing the bus messages in
    more detail and have effectively rewritten almost all of the borrowed code.
    
    Note that libthinkfinger is GPL licensed, so that reflects on this code too.
    At release time I will ask them if they are OK for me to relicense it.

    Enrollment tweaks
    
    upekts will need to know when the first enrollment stage is attempted for
    the first time, so add an __enroll_stage counter which actually indicates
    the next stage to enroll. -1 is a special value and it means 0 is next *and*
    it is the initial attemt.
    
    Added more debug output to the enroll handler.
    Added new fp_enroll_status codes for too short or uncentered scans.
    
    Changed the print_data allocator to consider the device rather than the
    driver, this feels more natural. Added missing return value.
    
    Make fp_enroll_status codes start at 1. 0 can now be used as a
    special/temporary value by the drivers. Also check that we aren't exceeding
    the number of enroll stages.
    
    Also add a missing exit() call to the verify example and update for the
    above.
